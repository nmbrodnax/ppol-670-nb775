## PPOL 670-01 Fall 2018

## Background
You have recently been hired as a data scientist for Towngeorge University.  Your first task is to assist the university in aligning its college majors with those published by the [College Board](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors-careers). 

The university provides you with a list of its current majors (available on Canvas).  Your supervisor suggests preparing your own KNN algorithm.  You conduct some research and find the following resources about KNN:

 * https://kevinzakka.github.io/2016/07/13/k-nearest-neighbor/
 * http://cs231n.github.io/classification/#nn 
 * https://saravananthirumuruganathan.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/a-detailed-introduction-to-k-nearest-neighbor-knn-algorithm/
 * http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html

How might you go about classifying these majors to correspond to a higher level classification?

## Activity

 1. How would you determine which majors to include?

 2. How might you measure the "distance" between a string and its "nearest neighbor"?
